This is a Lua port of the example-game "Raiders 3D", adapted from the listing of the legendary book ["Tricks of the 3d Game Programming Gurus: Advanced 3d Graphics and Rasterization"](https://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Programming-Gurus-Advanced-Graphics-Rasterization/dp/0672318350),
by author André [LaMothe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_LaMothe).


I've used the [LÖVR](https://lovr.org/) framework to simulate a simple buffer where you draw pixel-by-pixel, but you can use any backend you want by replacing the functions in `draw.lua`
